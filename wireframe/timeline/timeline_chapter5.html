        <p>As ISIS expanded itself further, it had no choice but to have more combats against Kurds and other rebel forces. Sarah Birke, an Arab expert at the Economist argued that al-Nusra shows strong tendency against Assad regime but ISIS focuses on its own hegemony. International coalition led by Washington overtook its aggressive operation against IS-occupied regions in Syria in September, 2014. Although US supported anti-Assad forces once again through Pentagon training program, the target of this program was rebel forces against ISIS, not the dictatorâ€™s regime.</p>

        <p>Keeping a similar level of attacks on local areas by regime forces, total number of operations called upon astonishment: 1,393 bombings, 635 shelling cases and 131 strikes of barrel bombings with 40 cases more year of year. The damage resulting from UN and Russia seem to be decreased, albeit notable increase of operations by Islamic State.</p>
