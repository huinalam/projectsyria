			<h2>2011<br>Pre-War Period</h2>
			<p>Before Syrian Civil War, political suppression of Assads' family more than 50 years led its own people to leave for the new destinations. According to UNHCR, 13,718 Syrian refugees were registered in 2011. 95% of those people stayed within Europe that year, while Germany accepted the largest portion of 10,155 refugees among European countries.

			<h2>2012<br>Escalation results in surge of refugees</h2>
			<p>The number of Syrian refugees skyrocketed in the mid of 2012 when the military provocations were at its semi-apex: sieges posed both by Assad regime and anti-government forces. Accordingly, Syrian people started to abandon their motherlands – the number reached 50 times as many as those who had left in 2011. Enormous diaspora reversed the distribution of refugees in inter-continental context, taking 96% of them in Middle Eastern region. Majority of refugees moved toward surrounding nations of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon - Turkey accepted the largest of 24,866 refugees.</p>

			<h2>2013<br>Culmination of Migrant Crisis: not only issue of EU<br></h2>
			<p>The year 2012 came to a head of having the largest number of victims and refugees ever recorded. The number of victims (2,415,374 in total) surged again 30 times more than that of last year and 98% of them came to stay in Middle East. As the incident got worsened, European countries have become at stake due to massive influx of refugees from Afghanistan and Syria, naming this phenomenon as European Migrant Crisis. However, Syrian neighbors had already accepted 50 times greater number of refugees than European countries did at this point.</p>

			<p>The result of analyzing the distribution of Syrian refugees in two continents shows two aspects of imbalance. First of all, XXX % of refugees have been staying in Germany and Sweden whereas Gulf states have showed its extreme reluctance for welcoming migrants. In 2014, it is said that only 18 Syrian refugees were accepted to stay in Saudi Arabia with its highest GDP figure in Gulf region.</p>
