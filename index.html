                        Syrian Civil War which has continued for 5 years has resulted in at least 132,559 fatalities based on the data of The Violation Documentation Center in Syria and 4,803,643 refugees (UNHCR). The world has observed direct and indirect involvement of other players such as its neighbors of Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and but also others like United Nations, Russia and US. Furthermore, Islamic State has largely made the phase of war much more complicated from 2014 when it caught attention around the world, shaping negative stereotype against whole Islamic culture.
                    </p>

                    <p>Amid this kind of chaos, this project was designed to shed light on notable incidents and cases due to migrant crisis caused by Civil War chiefly with two focuses.</p>

                    <h2>How serious migrant situation has been ongoing and what kinds of efforts have been made international community in a balanced manner?</h2>

                    <p>Analysis on UNHCR’s data about refugees enabled us to see imbalanced acceptance of displaced people from 2011 until now. Especially, more than 80% of refugees have found new destinations of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan within Middle East region, which permitted viewers to find out social and economic issues from severe government expenditure. This issue is not only related to each nation’s difficulty but also to refugees’ difficulty to keep their quality of living. However, other Gulf States of which economic standard is much higher have been reluctant to incorporate themselves into migrant crisis.</p>

                    <h2>Which players have been inflicting threats on Syrians within civil war?</h2>

                    <p>It is striking fact that the largest cause of the crisis is civil war. We could visualize the relevance between each data and number of fatalities on a monthly basis and also cases of civilian damages, refugees and etc., which further facilitated how deeply certain groups have involved in each incident. The fundamental intention of visualization is supposed to raise the question for the international community which questions we should voice up to relieve migrant crisis.</p>

In the meantime, the central government gained its full momentum to transform its political structure into an absolutistic way, eliminating discussion on measures against anti-government forces and also election process based on voting systems.

According to UNHCR, 13,718 Syrian refugees were registered in 2011. 95% of those people stayed within Europe that year, while Germany accepted the largest portion of 10,155 refugees among European countries.

                    <p>The number of Syrian refugees skyrocketed in the mid of 2012 when the military provocations were at its semi-apex: sieges posed both by Assad regime and anti-government forces. Accordingly, Syrian people started to abandon their motherlands – the number reached 50 times as many as those who had left in 2011. Enormous diaspora reversed the distribution of refugees in inter-continental context, taking 96% of them in Middle Eastern region. Majority of refugees moved toward surrounding nations of Turkey, Iraq, Jordan and Lebanon - Turkey accepted the largest of 24,866 refugees.</p>

The number of victims (2,415,374 in total) surged again 30 times more than that of last year and 98% of them came to stay in Middle East. As the incident got worsened, European countries have become at stake due to massive influx of refugees from Afghanistan and Syria, naming this phenomenon as European Migrant Crisis.

                <p>A scatter chart on the left suggests that imbalanced acceptance of refugees may lead economic pressure in some nations. Consequently, financial support to help sustain daily lives can’t reach large portion of the displaced.</p>
                <p>Among Gulf nations, Kuwait donated USD 165 million and Saudi Arabia decided to build up medical center for refugees in Yemen.</p>
                <p>In spite of financial support, Lebanon is expected to have USD 7.6 billion loss in terms of economic activities and USD 1.6 billion increase in terms of government expenditure. Meanwhile, in February 2016 Jordan hoped to find donor partners in London to relieve its burden due to its debt-riddled economy and also drop of medical reserves nationwide, which may result in adverse impact on domestic health issues.</p>
                <p>Nonetheless, Gulf Co-operation Council members have been reluctant to share more supportive actions due to some reasons such as: strict visa system and the status of the workers; doubts upon influx of anti-regime group of ISIS.</p>
