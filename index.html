                        Syrian Civil War which has continued for 5 years has resulted in at least 132,559 fatalities based on the data of The Violation Documentation Center in Syria and 4,803,643 refugees (UNHCR). The world has observed direct and indirect involvement of other players such as its neighbors of Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and but also others like United Nations, Russia and US. Furthermore, Islamic State has largely made the phase of war much more complicated from 2014 when it caught attention around the world, shaping negative stereotype against whole Islamic culture.
                    </p>

                    <p>Amid this kind of chaos, this project was designed to shed light on notable incidents and cases due to migrant crisis caused by Civil War chiefly with two focuses.</p>

                    <h2>What kinds of efforts have been made international community in a balanced manner?</h2>

                    <p>Analysis on UNHCR&#39;s data about refugees enabled us to see imbalanced acceptance of displaced people from 2011 until now. Especially, more than 80% of refugees have found new destinations of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan within Middle East region, which permitted viewers to find out social and economic issues from severe government expenditure. This issue is not only related to each nation&#39;s difficulty but also to refugees&#39; difficulty to keep their quality of living. However, other Gulf States of which economic standard is much higher have been reluctant to incorporate themselves into migrant crisis.</p>

                    <h2>Which players have been inflicting threats on Syrians within civil war?</h2>
                    <div class="introduction_wordCloud"></div>
                    <div class="exp"><p>The above wordcloud shows frequency of certain groups who mentioned in headline of Syrian Civil war related news from &#39;Newyork Times&#39; and &#39;the Guardian&#39;.</p></div>
                    <p>It is striking fact that the largest cause of the crisis is civil war. We could visualize the relevance between each data and number of fatalities on a monthly basis and also cases of civilian damages, refugees and etc., which further facilitated how deeply certain groups have involved in each incident. The fundamental intention of visualization is supposed to raise the question for the international community which questions we should voice up to relieve migrant crisis.</p>

                    <p>The data on refugees recorded in UNHCR start from 1968. With a view to understanding occurrence of the crisis and the background of civil war, it&#39;d better look into Syrian history of two Assads&#39; dictatorship for 50 years and types of suppression which the regimes have pushed against. This chapter concentrates on Syrian modern history after its independence from France to current regime of second Assad: what kinds of crackdown Syrian people have confronted and how these facts are coincided with the number of refugees each time.

In 1970, Hafez led coup d&#39;etat without bloody incident, taking advantage of fragile Jadid. Hafez didn&#39;t hesitate to visit local villages listening to real voices of citizens, totally different from the former leaders, and additionally decided to cut down the price of daily necessities, widening own popularity.</p>
                    <p>However, he overtook worshiping enactment by hanging his pictures in most public spaces and also by deifying himself as one similar to Mahomet. What was worse, extreme pursuit of private interests and political corruption resulted in Muslim Brotherhood Syria&#39;s expansion.</p>

                    <p>Islamist uprising by itself aimed at overturning the regime especially in northern regions, while its climax was Hama massacre in 1982, killing more than 25,000 people by Syrian Army troops(Syrian Human Rights Committee). It is said the city was bulldozed and destroyed by regime&#39;s forces. In the meantime, the central government gained its full momentum to transform its political structure into an absolutistic way, eliminating discussion on measures against anti-government forces and also election process based on voting systems.</p>
                    <p>Rapid turmoil not only in regional peace but also in its politics meant Syrian social structure became jeopardized in a serious manner: opposition activities became almost impossible; Emergency Law from 1963 to 2011 and military courts applied martial law.</p>

                    <p>After August 2001, Syrian camps were restarted to be filled with political prisoners and rights activists, while Syrian government established series of action to control media and publication.

Human Rights Watch acquires the list that says who are believed to be shot dead in Sednaya prison. It is said 25 people were killed, one of whom was a military police. Upon this information, no confirmation or statement has been officially announced by the regime.</p>
                    <p>Since the antipathy to such suppression became deteriorated, nationwide demonstration called &#39;Day of Rage&#39;sparked. With regime forces taking more violent actions against citizens, 4 unarmed demonstrators were killed in March 18th in Daraa, resulting in crucial tinderbox of civil war.</p>

Enormous diaspora reversed the distribution of refugees in inter-continental context, taking 96% of them in Middle Eastern region.

                <p>Imbalanced distribution of refugees is confirmed on the map above. UNHCR calculated $4,552,032,037 for a total sum of funds with a view to supporting currently-enrolled refugees, of which only 7% of them have been funded. Eventually, the finance is essential to help the refugees survive and sustain fundamental quality of living, whereas a nation can't finance all the expenses for the refugees.</p>

                <p>We've seen the imbalance of refugees distribution in Middle East by means of economic scope. Please look at the Scatter plot below. Axis x represents GDP of Middle East nations and axis y does the number of refugee acceptance. The size of circle reflects the number of refugees divided by GDP per capita, which indicates the number of refugees in comparison to each countries' relative economic status.</p>

            <h2>Arab Conscience</h2>
            <p>A scatter chart on the left suggests that imbalanced acceptance of refugees may lead economic pressure in some nations. Consequently, financial support to help sustain daily lives can&#39;t reach large portion of the displaced.</p>
            <p>Among Gulf nations, Kuwait donated USD 165 million and Saudi Arabia decided to build up medical center for refugees in Yemen.</p>
            <p>In spite of financial support, Lebanon is expected to have USD 7.6 billion loss in terms of economic activities and USD 1.6 billion increase in terms of government expenditure. Meanwhile, in February 2016 Jordan hoped to find donor partners in London to relieve its burden due to its debt-riddled economy and also drop of medical reserves nationwide, which may result in adverse impact on domestic health issues.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, Gulf Co-operation Council members have been reluctant to share more supportive actions due to some reasons such as: strict visa system and the status of the workers; doubts upon influx of anti-regime group of ISIS.</p>

So we analyzed the data of syriatracker.crowdmap.com which reports several damages inflicted against civilians in and around Syria. Syria Tracker, website utilizing group intelligence, allows anonymous users to directly report cases of civilian deaths, massacre, genocide and also chemical warfare. You can find detailed process of analysis in the section of methodology.</p>

                    <p>The worsened inner split of al-Qaeda&#39;s Syria branch resulted in the birth of ISIS in April. In the meantime, Assad regime killed 213 civilians by activating chemical weapons in August. Though Moscow pressured Damascus to give up the usage of chemical weapons and Syria accepted the proposal outwardly in September, continuous weapon uses have been observed. In the same month, rebel forces trained by CIA were deployed in al-Nusra, the Syrian branch of al-Qaeda. In first month of 2014, ISIS occupied Raqqa where government forces had controlled.</p>

                    <p>As ISIS expanded itself further, it had no choice but to have more combats against Kurds and other rebel forces. Sarah Birke, an Arab expert at the Economist argued that al-Nusra shows strong tendency against Assad regime but ISIS focuses on its own hegemony. International coalition led by Washington overtook its aggressive operation against IS-occupied regions in Syria in September, 2014. Although US supported anti-Assad forces once again through Pentagon training program, the target of this program was rebel forces against ISIS, not the dictator&#39;s regime.</p>

                        Summary of timeline analysis
                    </h2>
                    <h3>Finding1: The Most intensive Damages</h3>
                    <p>One of the largest characteristics we have seen in timeline is the worst damage happened after June 2012 during a year. More than 1,400 shelling incidents were reported only in November 2011 with other types of air strikes and direct bombings were also publicized. This coincides with the right point when the highest fatalities occurred the figures delclared seem to have something to do with death tolls and direct attacks.</p>

                    <h3>Finding2: Correlation between type of attcks and the number of deaths and refugees</h3>
                    <p>With a view to arranging influence on monthly death tolls and number of refugees by the frequency of 6 types of attacks, we tried to analyze result statistically. So to speak, Pearson&#39;s product-mement correlation was adapted as an algorism tool to connect the dots of interrelation between civilian assaults and the number of deaths or refugees. In this regards, the correlation becomes higher when the result stands near 1.</p>

                    <p>Primarily, the table below says the correlation between monthly fatalities and six types of assaults with absolute value of each attack being provided.</p>

                    </div>

                    <p>Followed by the table, shelling incidents (0.78) and air strike (0.61) show the highest value in correlation, while barrel bomb (0.049) and battle (0.16) represent the lowest relevance. It&#39;s why we chose to mark figure of total reports in order to consider possible influence which quantity and intention of attacks might have on the correlation itself. Let&#39;s see each figure: shelling incidents are the most reported with the highest correlation but; air strikes are less reported than battles with the second highest interrelation – it implies that air strikes could result in massive killings with minor number of assaults or maintain the higher intention on civilian areas as the very target.</p>

                    <p>In terms of number of refugees each month, it does not demonstrate direct correlation with frequency of attacks. It&#39;s because of the gap between the two of increasing refugees and deaths. However, when time axis be pushed forward by 5 months, the correlation is increased to 0.68, showing that there are 5 month-gap between civilian assaults and refugee crisis.</p>

                    <h3>Finding3: Moving toward fresh perspective</h3>
                    <p>The data used in the analysis process is from Syrian Violation Document Center with the cause of the deaths being recorded. Nevertheless, we tried to analyze the correlation between type of damage and death toll so as to make an assumption about the intention of attacks itself.</p>

                    <p>The cause of deaths by VDE does not specify additional reasons whether the casualty was due to attacks against local community or due to fresh attacks after the first battles between militants.</p>

                    <p>By making use of the category ‘battle’, however, it was also able to distinguish originally intended civilian attacks from secondly-led damage among battles. Looking at the data again, battles of 5,567 cases and its correlation with fatalities show considerably low degree of 0.16 but air strikes of 3,543 cases represent 0.61. In other words, though air strike has relative lower reports than battles, it causes almost quadrupled victims. Of course, deaths during battles can also not be justifiable but analytic process enables the viewers to see much more persons than expected dying owing to non-selective attacks, who may have zero relevance with civil war itself. The data once again confirms the cruelty of war.</p>

                    <p>We should not overlook the fact that the Assad regime is the factor that has been inflicting the most intense aggression against civilians for the time being until now. Iran and Hezbollah have played a significant role for the dictator during civil war and also Russia, United States, YPG and Islamic state have been involved in the conflicts. However, what is striking is the data of Syrian tracker that say assaults by Assad regime take holds of overwhelming calamities albeit all the other cases combined: approximately 1,143 air strike, 1,297 shelling cases and 528 international-law prohibited applications of barrel bomb. Even after its agreement of withdrawing chemical warfare with Russia in September 2013, chemicals-used war crimes have been detected: 16 cases reported after the year 2015. We once again stress out that most of data written here represent indiscriminate attacks against local citizens, not coincided with the battle cases against Free Syrian Army.</p>

                        Lebanese armed group of Hezbollah has been concerned with relevant reports, taking second place after Assad regime. Looking at the data, civilian calamities were put to by providing armed forces with armaments such as bombers, rocket launchers and others related to on-ground individual combats. Shelling cases have the strongest relevance with Hezbollah, having 24 cases recorded. Since it is widely reported that Hezbollah has been moving itself with Iranian dispatched division and regime forces, the actual impact would be more fatal. The two-year term of 2013(20 shelling cases) and 2014 (4) have been showing its most military actions with relevant reports decreased after 2015. In other words, Hezbollah is said to support Assad forces directly with Iranian militants, debilitating regional communities.

                    <p>
                        IS has been actively working on its expansion toward northern Syria amid inner chaos, having its center in the city of Raqqa. According to NYT <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2015/06/17/world/middleeast/map-isis-attacks-around-the-world.html?_r=0" target="_blank">(link)</a>, IS has involved itself in civil war and about 50 terrors in several continents of Middle East, Europe and Africa throughout 2 years. Data analysis says that ** 30 battles and 16 direct attack ** by ISIS have been reported. Considering its genuine difficulty in incorporating data within IS-occupied regions, the number of fatal cases committed by IS is supposed to be a lot more.

                    <h3>Russia</h3>
                    <p>It was September 2015 when Russia officially announced its military intervention of Syria under the name of repulsive onslaughts against Islamic State. However, its air-strikes exerted civilian losses long before that point from 2012, reaching the highest frequency in 2014. Russia has been the target of suspicion to attack purposely-planned assaults on civilian areas, not only on IS-occupied regions, proved by the very data here. Among outside players of Middle East, Russia seems to represent the largest damage factor.</p>

                    <h3>International Coalition</h3>
                    <p>By the same token with Russia, US-led coalition of United Nations with European countries has been targeting IS-occupying regions but their intervention also had its limitation since it could not pick up the right places under IS influences. What UN cases have difference with Russians&#39; is lower frequency and the reported time. 10 times of bombing and shelling cases imposed by UN have been recorded respectively after 2015.</p>

                    <h3>YPG</h3>
                    <p>Kurds people have aimed at its secession amid Syrian civil war. Tactically, they have been against both regime and anti-regime forces in northern areas to achieve its expansion, while the regime strategically pursued its softer stance owing to further stronger resistance of anti-Assad forces. Civilian crisis committed by YPG are raids in border areas, arrest and non-clarified direct attacks cases rather than offensives using heavy weapons. In total, OO cases of murder have been mentioned, including female and child victims. Since Kurds have long history without own territory, it&#39;s difficult to have judgment on if military operations for independence have validity during civil war chaos. What is clear at least is that if Kurds are not able to parallel its interest with any of war-involved groups with longer period of civil conflicts, they would consistently harm civilians as much as other groups have committed.</p>

                <h2>About Bias</h2>
                <p>There is possibility that a bit of bias can be generated based on data analysis for some grounds.</p>

                <h3 id="green">Technological limitation</h3>
                <p>Firstly, the limitation in technological manner clearly exists to fully analyze more than 5,000 sentences. Our team has invested a lot of time with a view to breaking down each sentence and paragraph in a meaningful way. Still, we could detect some erroneous parts since algorisms we used sometimes consider two different incidents just as one combined. For example, it was doubtful to see the number of 14 in terms of Russia&#39;s chemical weapon uses, while the actual sentence refers to more than 2 cases.</p>

                <h3 id="green">Data collection and its limitation</h3>
                <p>Secondly, the data on Syria Tracker may also have its own limit on acquisition. Notably, even inside Syria, it is highly difficult to confirm overall data such as fatalities in IS-occupying regions. One of our intentions is to demonstrate other overlooked assailants within civil war owing to provocations of Islamic State, implying that civilian damage inflicted by IS would be a lot larger.</p>

                <h3 id="green">Limitation of reporters</h3>
                <p>Amid analysis process, it is also available to check out some cases which were not be able to be confirmed on who led the assaults. This fact gives us probability that misjudgment on verifying attackers can exist. In terms of airstrikes, the result says 1143 cases by Assad regime, 25 by Russia but not sure to regard more than 1000 strikes as those only committed by the regime. We think that damage resulted in by Russia&#39;s aerial bombardment would not be reflected enough since Assad regime has been supported directly by Moscow.</p>

                <h2>Data collection as witnessed by Syrian people</h2>
                <p>Regardless of some limits, these data have told us how large attacks have been put against civilians by regime and other external groups. Bombing and shelling incidents more than 1,000 times for 5 years would be plausible reason why many Syrians were forced to leave out of the country to become refugees.</p>
                <p>Secondly, witnesses report what they have seen directly and they become the roots of the very data. Even if it is hard to achieve perfect match of assailants and types of attacks, the data give us clues about which group have been attacking against citizens, themselves.</p>
                <p>It is highly difficult to persuade somebody by figures. However, at least, we would like to raise questions to those who have read up to this part.</p>
                <p>What kinds of efforts should international community do with a view to cooling down severe life journey of refugees and civil war?</p>
