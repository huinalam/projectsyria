                        Syrian Civil War which has continued for 5 years has resulted in at least 132,559 fatalities based on the data of The Violation Documentation Center in Syria and 4,803,643 refugees (UNHCR). The world has observed direct and indirect involvement of other players such as its neighbors of Turkey, Iran, Saudi Arabia and but also others like United Nations, Russia and US. Furthermore, Islamic State has largely made the phase of war much more complicated from 2014 when it caught attention around the world, shaping negative stereotype against whole Islamic culture.
                    </p>

                    <p>Amid this kind of chaos, this project was designed to shed light on notable incidents and cases due to migrant crisis caused by Civil War chiefly with two focuses.</p>

                    <h2>How serious migrant situation has been ongoing and what kinds of efforts have been made international community in a balanced manner?</h2>

                    <p>Analysis on UNHCR&#39;s data about refugees enabled us to see imbalanced acceptance of displaced people from 2011 until now. Especially, more than 80% of refugees have found new destinations of Turkey, Lebanon and Jordan within Middle East region, which permitted viewers to find out social and economic issues from severe government expenditure. This issue is not only related to each nation&#39;s difficulty but also to refugees&#39; difficulty to keep their quality of living. However, other Gulf States of which economic standard is much higher have been reluctant to incorporate themselves into migrant crisis.</p>

                    <h2>Which players have been inflicting threats on Syrians within civil war?</h2>

                    <p>It is striking fact that the largest cause of the crisis is civil war. We could visualize the relevance between each data and number of fatalities on a monthly basis and also cases of civilian damages, refugees and etc., which further facilitated how deeply certain groups have involved in each incident. The fundamental intention of visualization is supposed to raise the question for the international community which questions we should voice up to relieve migrant crisis.</p>

                    <p>The data on refugees recorded in UNHCR start from 1968. With a view to understanding occurrence of the crisis and the background of civil war, it&#39;d better look into Syrian history of two Assads&#39; dictatorship for 50 years and types of suppression which the regimes have pushed against. This chapter concentrates on Syrian modern history after its independence from France to current regime of second Assad: what kinds of crackdown Syrian people have confronted and how these facts are coincided with the number of refugees each time.

                        After World War I, Arab Kingdom of Syria was announced but soon became French mandate.

                    <p>Hafez al-Assad started his career in air force with his stance being consolidated during Jadid regime in 1960s. In 1970, Hafez led coup d&#39;Ã©tat without bloody incident, taking advantage of fragile Jadid. Hafez didn&#39;t hesitate to visit local villages listening to real voices of citizens, totally different from the former leaders, and additionally decided to cut down the price of daily necessities, widening own popularity.</p>
                    <p>However, he overtook worshiping enactment by hanging his pictures in most public spaces and also by deifying himself as one similar to Mahomet. What was worse, extreme pursuit of private interests and political corruption resulted in Muslim Brotherhood Syria&#39;s expansion.</p>

It is said the city was bulldozed and destroyed by regime&#39;s forces. In the meantime, the central government gained its full momentum to transform its political structure into an absolutistic way, eliminating discussion on measures against anti-government forces and also election process based on voting systems.</p>

Enormous diaspora reversed the distribution of refugees in inter-continental context, taking 96% of them in Middle Eastern region.

                    <p>9 major combats were taken place from March to August of 2015 and extreme complexity can be found in terms of struggles for expansion including Assad forces, rebel forces, Hezbollah, IS and finally Kurds. In September of 2015, Russia officially announced its military intervention in Syria under the reason of a repulse against ISIS forces. However, local media outlets including ˜Halab today&#39; has been distributing the videos relevant to their suspicions that Russian targets in Syria have been anti-regime forces-held regions and other civilian areas.</p>

Compared to the past period, military operations of other groups were a bit less reported but the assaults on civilian areas were not ceased. The extent of damage inflicted by barrel bomb reached 893 cases eight times higher over last year.</p>

                If looked at whether there was any kind of private damage during the civil war in the previous chapter, we analyze that how associations are no forces on the civilian damage in this chapter. We analyzed what they came to inflict damage any civilian forces to analyze the data provided by the Syrian Network For Human Right Syria tracker and a sentence or paragraph basis. We used six types of attacks as before the timeline, Assad regime, Hezbollah, Islamic State, Russia, International Coalition, analyzed the data for the YPG.

                    <h3>Assad Regime</h3>
                    <p>We should not overlook the fact that the Assad regime is the factor that has been inflicting the most intense aggression against civilians for the time being until now. Iran and Hezbollah have played a significant role for the dictator during civil war and also Russia, United States, YPG and Islamic state have been involved in the conflicts. However, what is striking is the data of Syrian tracker that say assaults by Assad regime take holds of overwhelming calamities albeit all the other cases combined: approximately 1,143 air strike, 1,297 shelling cases and 528 international-law prohibited applications of barrel bomb. Even after its agreement of withdrawing chemical warfare with Russia in September 2013, chemicals-used war crimes have been detected: 16 cases reported after the year 2015. We once again stress out that most of data written here represent indiscriminate attacks against local citizens, not coincided with the battle cases against Free Syrian Army.</p>

                    <p>
                        Lebanese armed group of Hezbollah has been concerned with relevant reports, taking second place after Assad regime. Looking at the data, civilian calamities were put to by providing armed forces with armaments such as bombers, rocket launchers and others related to on-ground individual combats. Shelling cases have the strongest relevance with Hezbollah, having 24 cases recorded. Since it is widely reported that Hezbollah has been moving itself with Iranian dispatched division and regime forces, the actual impact would be more fatal. The two-year term of 2013(20 shelling cases) and 2014 (4) have been showing its most military actions with relevant reports decreased after 2015. In other words, Hezbollah is said to support Assad forces directly with Iranian militants, debilitating regional communities.

                        IS has been actively working on its expansion toward northern Syria amid inner chaos, having its center in the city of Raqqa. According to <href>NYT</href>, IS has involved itself in civil war and about 50 terrors in several continents of Middle East, Europe and Africa throughout 2 years. Data analysis says that ** 30 battles and 16 direct attack ** by ISIS have been reported. Considering its genuine difficulty in incorporating data within IS-occupied regions, the number of fatal cases committed by IS is supposed to be a lot more.

                    <p>It was September 2015 when Russia officially announced its military intervention of Syria under the name of repulsive onslaughts against Islamic State. However, its air-strikes exerted civilian losses long before that point from 2012, reaching the highest frequency in 2014. Russia has been the target of suspicion to attack purposely-planned assaults on civilian areas, not only on IS-occupied regions, proved by the very data here. Among outside players of Middle East, Russia seems to represent the largest damage factor.</p>

                    <p>Kurds people have aimed at its secession amid Syrian civil war. Tactically, they have been against both regime and anti-regime forces in northern areas to achieve its expansion, while the regime strategically pursued its softer stance owing to further stronger resistance of anti-Assad forces. Civilian crisis committed by YPG are raids in border areas, arrest and non-clarified direct attacks cases rather than offensives using heavy weapons. In total, OO cases of murder have been mentioned, including female and child victims. Since Kurds have long history without own territory, it&#39;s difficult to have judgment on if military operations for independence have validity during civil war chaos. What is clear at least is that if Kurds are not able to parallel its interest with any of war-involved groups with longer period of civil conflicts, they would consistently harm civilians as much as other groups have committed.</p>

                <h2>About Bias</h2>
                <p>There is possibility that a bit of bias can be generated based on data analysis for some grounds.</p>

                <h3>Technological limitation</h3>
                <p>Firstly, the limitation in technological manner clearly exists to fully analyze more than 5,000 sentences. Our team has invested a lot of time with a view to breaking down each sentence and paragraph in a meaningful way. Still, we could detect some erroneous parts since algorisms we used sometimes consider two different incidents just as one combined. For example, it was doubtful to see the number of 14 in terms of Russia™s chemical weapon uses, while the actual sentence refers to more than 2 cases.</p>

                <h3>Data collection and its limitation</h3>
                <p>Secondly, the data on Syria Tracker may also have its own limit on acquisition. Notably, even inside Syria, it is highly difficult to confirm overall data such as fatalities in IS-occupying regions. One of our intentions is to demonstrate other overlooked assailants within civil war owing to provocations of Islamic State, implying that civilian damage inflicted by IS would be a lot larger.</p>

                <h3>Limitation of reporters</h3>
                <p>Amid analysis process, it is also available to check out some cases which were not be able to be confirmed on who led the assaults. This fact gives us probability that misjudgment on verifying attackers can exist. In terms of airstrikes, the result says 1143 cases by Assad regime, 25 by Russia but not sure to regard more than 1000 strikes as those only committed by the regime. We think that damage resulted in by Russia™s aerial bombardment would not be reflected enough since Assad regime has been supported directly by Moscow.</p>
            </div>
            <div class="chapter_article_div">
                <h2>Data collection as witnessed by Syrian people</h2>
                <p>Regardless of some limits, these data have told us how large attacks have been put against civilians by regime and other external groups. Bombing and shelling incidents more than 1,000 times for 5 years would be plausible reason why many Syrians were forced to leave out of the country to become refugees.</p>
                <p>Secondly, witnesses report what they have seen directly and they become the roots of the very data. Even if it is hard to achieve perfect match of assailants and types of attacks, the data give us clues about which group have been attacking against citizens, themselves.</p>
                <p>It is highly difficult to persuade somebody by figures. However, at least, we would like to raise questions to those who have read up to this part.</p>
                <p>What kinds of efforts should international community do with a view to cooling down severe life journey of refugees and civil war?</p>
