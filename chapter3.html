International coalition led by Washington overtook its aggressive operation against IS-occupied regions in Syria in September, 2014. Although US supported anti-Assad forces once again through Pentagon training program, the target of this program was rebel forces against ISIS, not the dictator’s regime.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>9 major combats were taken place from March to August of 2015 and extreme complexity can be found in terms of struggles for expansion including Assad forces, rebel forces, Hezbollah, IS and finally Kurds. In September of 2015, Russia officially announced its military intervention in Syria under the reason of a repulse against ISIS forces. However, local media outlets including ‘Halab today’ has been distributing the videos relevant to their suspicions that Russian targets in Syria have been anti-regime forces-held regions and other civilian areas.</p>

                    <p>Since March 2014, approximately 2,500 deaths have continued each month. Even though the number of refugees seemed to show its decrease on a monthly basis, the refugees registered were at its far-highest point on March 2015 and January 2016. Compared to the past period, military operations of other groups were a bit less reported but the assaults on civilian areas were not ceased. The extent of damage inflicted by barrel bomb reached 893 cases eight times higher over last year.</p>

                        Summary of timeline analysis
                    </h2>
                    <h3>Finding1: The Most intensive Damages</h3>
                    <p>One of the largest characteristics we have seen in timeline is the worst damage happened after June 2012 during a year. More than 1,400 shelling incidents were reported only in November 2011 with other types of air strikes and direct bombings were also publicized. This coincides with the right point when the highest fatalities occurred the figures delclared seem to have something to do with death tolls and direct attacks.</p>

                    <h3>Finding2: Correlation between type of attcks and the number of deaths and refugees</h3>
                    <p>With a view to arranging influence on monthly death tolls and number of refugees by the frequency of 6 types of attacks, we tried to analyze result statistically. So to speak, Pearson&#39;s product-mement correlation was adapted as an algorism tool to connect the dots of interrelation between civilian assaults and the number of deaths or refugees. In this regards, the correlation becomes higher when the result stands near 1.</p>

                    <p>Primarily, the table below says the correlation between monthly fatalities and six types of assaults with absolute value of each attack being provided.</p>
                   

                    <p>Followed by the table, shelling incidents (0.78) and air strike (0.61) show the highest value in correlation, while barrel bomb (0.049) and battle (0.16) represent the lowest relevance. It&#39;s why we chose to mark figure of total reports in order to consider possible influence which quantity and intention of attacks might have on the correlation itself. Let&#39;s see each figure: shelling incidents are the most reported with the highest correlation but; air strikes are less reported than battles with the second highest interrelation – it implies that air strikes could result in massive killings with minor number of assaults or maintain the higher intention on civilian areas as the very target.</p>

                    <p>In terms of number of refugees each month, it does not demonstrate direct correlation with frequency of attacks. It&#39;s because of the gap between the two of increasing refugees and deaths. However, when time axis be pushed forward by 5 months, the correlation is increased to 0.68, showing that there are 5 month-gap between civilian assaults and refugee crisis.</p>

                    <h3>Finding3: Moving toward fresh perspective</h3>
                    <p>The data used in the analysis process is from Syrian Violation Document Center with the cause of the deaths being recorded. Nevertheless, we tried to analyze the correlation between type of damage and death toll so as to make an assumption about the intention of attacks itself.</p>

                    <p>The cause of deaths by VDE does not specify additional reasons whether the casualty was due to attacks against local community or due to fresh attacks after the first battles between militants.</p>

                    <p>By making use of the category ‘battle’, however, it was also able to distinguish originally intended civilian attacks from secondly-led damage among battles. Looking at the data again, battles of 5,567 cases and its correlation with fatalities show considerably low degree of 0.16 but air strikes of 3,543 cases represent 0.61. In other words, though air strike has relative lower reports than battles, it causes almost quadrupled victims. Of course, deaths during battles can also not be justifiable but analytic process enables the viewers to see much more persons than expected dying owing to non-selective attacks, who may have zero relevance with civil war itself. The data once again confirms the cruelty of war.</p>
