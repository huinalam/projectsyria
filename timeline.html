                    <p>As ISIS expanded itself further, it had no choice but to have more combats against Kurds and other rebel forces. Sarah Birke, an Arab expert at the Economist argued that al-Nusra shows strong tendency against Assad regime but ISIS focuses on its own hegemony. International coalition led by Washington overtook its aggressive operation against IS-occupied regions in Syria in September, 2014. Although US supported anti-Assad forces once again through Pentagon training program, the target of this program was rebel forces against ISIS, not the dictator’s regime.</p>

                    <p>Since March 2014, approximately 2,500 deaths have continued each month. Even though the number of refugees seemed to show its decrease on a monthly basis, the refugees registered were at its far-highest point on March 2015 and January 2016. Compared to the past period, military operations of other groups were a bit less reported but the assaults on civilian areas were not ceased. The extent of damage inflicted by barrel bomb reached 893 cases eight times higher over last year.</p>

                    <h3>Summary</h3>
                    <p>On February 27th of 2016, UN Security Council passed the resolution N. 2254 which has its aim at preparing for armistice of Syrian Civil War. <!-- 분량때문에 어떻게할지 고민중!-->However, the actual question was the validity of the resolution. After a truce agreement, both sides has been arguing that each side is clearly violating the agreement. Within continuous chaos, Russia decided to withdraw its residing forces, sending one fighter jet back to Moscow in March 15th.</p>

The decrease of bombings and shelling cases was seemingly found, whereas direct target became civilians once again in a higher rate around June 2015, leading more than 2,500 mortalities every month. Information on Russian operations is expected to represent its activities before official withdrawal.</p>

Axis x represents GDP of Middle East nations and axis y does the number of refugee acceptance. The size of circle reflects the number of refugees divided by GDP per capita, which indicates the number of refugees in comparison to each countries' relative economic status.
