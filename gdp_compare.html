                <p>No significant characteristics were found in 2011 in terms of refugees since only 700 refugees were staying in Middle East. However, it is possible at least to compare GDP by nations: Saudi Arabia, a persian gulf-nation highest, Turkey, the second and Egypt, UAE and Iraq in order.</p>

                </div>
                <p>After a breakout of civil war, the number of refugees jumped in 2012, leading almost equivalent influx toward Turkey and Jordan. The location and scale of circle shows that Jordan took relatively larger burden in accepting refugees.</p>

                <p>Notably, the rapid increase of refugees was found in Jordan and Lebanon, while Iraq accepted the largest number of refugees among Gulf nations.</p>

                </div>
                <p>In 2014, Turkey and Lebanon saw dramatic surge in terms of Syrian refugees staying within its border. The circle of Turkey shows that it takes holds of considerable economic difficulty in supporting current refugees even though the republic has the second highest GDP in Middle East region</p>

            <h2>Arab Conscience</h2>
            <p>A scatter chart on the left suggests that imbalanced acceptance of refugees may lead economic pressure in some nations. Consequently, financial support to help sustain daily lives can&#39;t reach large portion of the displaced.</p>
            <p>Among Gulf nations, Kuwait donated USD 165 million and Saudi Arabia decided to build up medical center for refugees in Yemen.</p>
            <p>In spite of financial support, Lebanon is expected to have USD 7.6 billion loss in terms of economic activities and USD 1.6 billion increase in terms of government expenditure. Meanwhile, in February 2016 Jordan hoped to find donor partners in London to relieve its burden due to its debt-riddled economy and also drop of medical reserves nationwide, which may result in adverse impact on domestic health issues.</p>
            <p>Nonetheless, Gulf Co-operation Council members have been reluctant to share more supportive actions due to some reasons such as: strict visa system and the status of the workers; doubts upon influx of anti-regime group of ISIS.</p>
