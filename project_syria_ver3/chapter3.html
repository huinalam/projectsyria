                <p>Our intention is to focus on why almost half of Syrian population had no choice but to leave the motherlands and which types of life threats have existed from the viewpoint of themselves. So we analyzed the data of syriatracker.crowdmap.com which reports several damages inflicted against civilians in and around Syria. Syria Tracker, website utilizing group intelligence, allows anonymous users to directly report cases of civilian deaths, massacre, genocide and also chemical warfare. You can find detailed process of analysis in the section of methodology.</p>

                <p>By extracted data, timeline says the type of civilian losses and its frequency, fatalities and number of refugees on a monthly and yearly basis. Hence, we intended to let our viewers find out relevance between each data by pointing out which groups are related to certain types of incidents and which sorts of incidents were occurred. From 2011 to April 2016, 7 chapters are dissected as of patterns of civil war and also major timeline cases.</p>

                <p>Indicating recent for months, sieges posed toward civilians have dropped remarkably with operations of regime and Russia being reported, however. The decrease of bombings and shelling cases was seemingly found, whereas direct target became civilians once again in a higher rate around June 2015, leading more than 2,500 mortalities every month. Information on Russian operations is expected to represent its activities before official withdrawal.</p>
